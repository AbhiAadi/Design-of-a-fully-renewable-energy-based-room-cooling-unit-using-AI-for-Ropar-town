# Design-of-a-fully-renewable-energy-based-room-cooling-unit-using-AI-for-Ropar-town

## Project Overview
This project aims to design a fully renewable energy-based cooling unit, tailored to the climate of Ropar town, using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The solution focuses on reducing energy consumption and environmental impact while maintaining optimal indoor comfort for residents. A machine learning model is trained to predict the energy requirements (heating and cooling loads) based on climate and weather data.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: The model predicts cooling and heating loads with high accuracy using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
- **Renewable Energy Integration**: The system is entirely based on renewable energy, contributing to sustainability goals.
- **Climate-Specific**: Optimized for Roparâ€™s climate conditions, ensuring efficient operation.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces energy consumption by optimizing heating and cooling loads based on real-time data inputs like temperature, humidity, and radiative intensity.

## Methodology
- Developed using a multilayer perceptron model in TensorFlow to predict the energy loads.
- Employed data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, outlier removal, and dropout regularization to enhance model performance.
- Trained the model using data related to local climate conditions, including temperature, humidity, and radiative intensity.
- Evaluated the model using metrics like R-squared (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Results
- The model achieved high accuracy, with R2 scores above 0.98 and MAPE less than 10% for cooling capacity predictions, where as for heating loads 0.97 for R2 score and less then 15% for MAPE value.
- Demonstrated efficiency in predicting heating and cooling loads for different seasonal variations.
- The project showed promise in scaling for different climates and building types.

## Future Work
- Extend the model to include other renewable energy sources and optimize for various building types.
- Implement real-time energy monitoring and control mechanisms to further improve energy efficiency.
